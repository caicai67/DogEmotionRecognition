Installing Scikit-image (skimage)

How I did it:
1. installed python 2.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Downloaded miniconda from here: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
3. moved the “Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh” file to my current user directory, and 	navigated to that directory in the terminal
4. typed “bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh” into the terminal/command prompt to 		install conda
5. typed “conda install scikit-image” to install scikit-image


if something goes wrong:
	you might also need setup tools (“pip install -U pip setuptools”)
	and if pip isn’t working install it per instructions here:
